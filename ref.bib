  abstract = "Nearly every Ph.D. student in mathematics needs to take a
              preliminary or qualifyingexamination in real analysis. This book
              provides the necessary tools topass such an examination. Clarity:
              Every effort was made to present thematerial in as clear a
              fashion as possible. Lots of exercises: Over 400 exercises,
              rangingfrom routine to challenging, are presented. Many aretaken
              from preliminary examinations given at major universities.
              Affordability: This book is priced at wellunder \$15. Topics
              covered include the definition and construction of measures,
              theLebesgue integral and its properties,limit theorems, product
              measures, signed measures,the Radon-Nikoydym theorem,
              differentiation,Lp spaces, Fourier transforms, theRiesz
              representation theorem, and Banach and Hilbert spaces.",
